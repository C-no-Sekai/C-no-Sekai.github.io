        Hey there, to check your grades and fill out qalam forms, you'll need to
        register first. Just make sure to enter the correct password and email
        the first time around. Once you've done that, your account will be
        created in about 20 seconds. After that, you can log in with your email
        and password and view your predicted grades and fill out qalam forms.
        Keep in mind that these grades are predicted using a machine learning
        formula, and the accuracy increases as more students log in. If there
        are any updates to your results on the university website, you'll need
        to register again to see the updated information. If you run into any
        problems, feel free to reach out to yyaredaze65@gmail.com for help or
        click <a href="mailto:yyaredaze65@gmail.com">here</a>.
