        Hey there, to check your grades and fill out qalam forms, you'll need to
        register first. Just make sure to enter the correct password and email
        the first time around. Once you've done that, your account will be
        created in about 20 seconds. After that, you can log in with your email
        and password and view your predicted grades and fill out qalam forms.
        Keep in mind that these grades are predicted using a machine learning
        formula, and the accuracy increases as more students log in. If there
        are any updates to your results on the university website, you'll need
        to register again to see the updated information. For filling the
        Teacher Evaluation Forms you can press the auto form filler it will fill
        the forms without you touching any of them. You will also need to edit
        your the weightage of every subject, as the weightage is dependent on
        the teacher, it will show you the grade and aggregate according to the
        weightage you entered regardless of what anyone else has entered. If you
        run into any problems, feel free to reach out to yyaredaze65@gmail.com
